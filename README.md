# TODO

Frontend design is finished, so it means I have to start coding the frontend.
For now, I plan to do it with dummy data/local data.
I will also have to use Illustrator to design svg/vectors I can not get free access to.
The frontend isn't challenging, it is just different from what I have used React for.
I plan to use CRA for now, but this could change in the future.
